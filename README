## Functional Requirements

The hardware we are using was actually iPhone hardware (iPhone 15 Pro Max) 
The company wants to invest in owning their own infrastructure.
There is a concern about cost and privacy.

They want to invest in an AI phone and cut cost and be able to issue phones to the students 
making use much more feasible in Madrid, Spain. 

##Assumptions
We are assuming that the technology within phones will advance rapidly and AI will be able 
to run super fast and effictively. This saves a ton of cost and allows us to prepare 
for the future. 

These are Open-Source LLMS and can function on a single server in our office location 
which will be enough bandwidth to serve 300 students. 

##Data Strategy
There is a concern about copyright materials. So we must purchase and supply 
materials and store them in our vector database.
